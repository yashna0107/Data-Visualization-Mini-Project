							<h4>Chart 1: Number of university enrollments, by gender in Canada from 1992 to 2009 </h4>

						<p align = center> The above line chart demonstrates number of university enrollments, by gender in Canada from 1992 to 2009. It can be seen that in 1992,
							the share of university admissions accounted for by women had surpassed that of men. In 1992, when the total enrollments numbered
							885,645 students, the share accounted for by females was 56%. Of the 1,066,650 students who got admitted in 2007, 58% were women.
							This male/female gap has steadily grown over time, especially in the most recent years. </p>

								<h4>Chart 2: Number of university enrollments, by field of study: Mathematics,
							 		Computer and Information Sciences from 1992 to 2009 </h4>
							</header>
						<div class="container">
							<div id="tech"></div>
							</div>
							<script src="assets/js/tech.js"></script>
						<p align = center> The field of study which saw a decrease in the female share of enrollments between 1992 and 2007 wereâ€“mathematics,
					 		computer and information sciences. Number of male students studying in this field outnumbered the female students by
					  	87% in average from 1992 till 2009. However, the number of both male and female students graduating with
							a university degree in mathematics, computer and information sciences decreased between 2004 and 2007, with the
							decrease being particularly marked for males.</p>
							<header>
								<h4>Chart 3: Number of university enrollments, by field of study: Social and Behavioural Sciences and Law from 1992 to 2009</h4>
							</header>
						<div class="container">
							<div id="social"></div>
							</div>
							<script src="assets/js/social.js"></script>
							<p align = center> Over the course of two decades, there has been a marginal increase of male enrollments in the field
							of Social and behavioural sciences and law; however, there is a staggering  rise in female enrollments by approximately 33%.
						Furthermore, it is noteworthy that despite a minor drop of approximately 1000 in enrollments between 1994 and 2001 amongst both the
						genders, there has always been a greater gap in enrollments amongst females and males in Social and behavioural sciences and law,
					by females leading with more than 3000 that ends up widening the gap upto 6000 by the end of 2009. </p>
